## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects.

### I Use Heroku to deploy my application
Heroku is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages. One of the first cloud platforms, Heroku has been in development since June 2007, when it supported only the Ruby programming language, but now supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go.

- First, create heroku account, then download heroku on your machine and create new application using command line (heroku create <app_name>)
- Sometimes, heroku ask for account verification (set credit card). You can also create it on dashboard.heroku

One time app is created, you can log in using command line (heroku login) or in an interactive way (heroku login -i)
- Create heroku remote (heroku remote -v)
- Push project on heroku remote (git push heroku master)
